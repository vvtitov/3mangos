            One day, three mangos rolled off a fruit stand and landed right in
            front of a struggling developer. Frustrated with his broken code, he
            sighed, &apos;If only you three knew how to programâ€¦&quot; To his
            surprise, the mangos glowed and, through some bizarre cosmic glitch,
            started writing flawless code. Stunned, he founded{" "}
            <strong>THREE MANGOS</strong>, claiming his secret team of coding
            mangos powered the company. Investors thought it was a jokeâ€”until
            3MANGOS started delivering top-tier software. To this day, no one
            knows the truthâ€¦ except for the three very, very wise mangos.
